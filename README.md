# postgres-stream

Storing files in the database can be useful in some scenarios:

- When you need file storage to respect database transactional boundries.
- When you have limited resources to create and maintain separate authorization and backup infrastructure for file storage.
- When files are small and you would like to avoid separate interfaces for doing file IO and DB IO.

This means that for a specific kind of project database storage of files can greatly simplify the code base.

postgres-stream will implement streaming of large objects from the database to the browser handling the cache headers.

## API

This project will use a single relation inside its own namespace to store all files.
The only information necessary to access files is the file ID (generated by hashing the file content).



```
GET /postgres-stream/:file-id
```

Which will expose the file as a stream.
